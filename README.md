# Jennifer 🤍
**`Software Engineer, CS Student & Founder`**

I'm a software engineer and computer science student with a focus on building practical, user-centered applications. My work spans backend development with Java and Spring Boot, frontend interfaces with React and Next.js, and full-stack personal projects that help me refine my engineering skills.
I’ve worked across different areas of tech through freelancing, startup work, and academic projects. My experience includes building REST APIs, designing relational database models, integrating third-party services like the Notion API, deploying to cloud platforms, and developing interactive user interfaces. I’m particularly interested in creating tools that blend functionality with thoughtful, aesthetic design.

## 💻 What I'm Currently Working On

I currently build and maintain a range of small but functional applications. These projects serve both as part of my learning process and as examples for others interested in developing clean, accessible full-stack applications.

### Selfsaga

SelfSaga is a personal growth and productivity app designed for young women who feel overwhelmed, inconsistent, or bored with traditional productivity tools. Instead of relying on strict routines, SelfSaga blends journaling, light gamification, and guided “growth chapters” to make progress feel soft, flexible, and sustainable.
<!--The web app is built around themes such as focus, confidence, boundaries, and self-worth. Each theme is structured as a chapter with prompts, exercises, reflections, and small daily actions. Users earn gentle progress markers (like XP and badges) for showing up, without being punished for lapses or “broken streaks”.-->

SelfSaga’s concept and feature set are informed by a survey of 87 respondents across multiple age groups. The research highlighted recurring pain points such as overwhelm, forgetting goals, lack of accountability, and low motivation, as well as clear interest in templates, AI support, story-driven growth, and small accountability circles. This data shapes the app’s direction, including a freemium model with optional premium features.
The first version focuses on delivering a calm, non-clinical experience with structured journaling, soft gamification, and early AI-assisted guidance. Future iterations will expand into accountability circles, more advanced AI personalisation, and curated growth chapters that users can move through at their own pace.


### Ntụgharị (The Bridge)

Ntụgharị is a language-learning application focused on helping diaspora and second-generation Igbo speakers move from passive understanding to confident speaking. Many Igbo learners can follow conversations but struggle to produce the language due to lack of practice, performance anxiety, and limited exposure to active recall. Ntụgharị is built to directly address this gap. <br/>
The goal of the project is to offer a practical, culturally grounded tool that supports learners who want to reconnect with the language, improve fluency, and feel comfortable expressing themselves. This is especially relevant for second-generation Igbo people who understand the language well but hesitate to speak it.
The app provides a low-pressure environment for practicing spoken Igbo, combining reading, listening, and guided speaking exercises. Instead of emphasizing grammar drills or memorizing isolated vocabulary, Ntụgharị uses short, realistic phrases and progressively structured prompts to develop the ability to form sentences naturally.

Ntụgharị is currently in early development.
